                                Edward Lozansky’s organization has many fellows who have written false or misleading information, according to an archived version of the site from 2017.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These include Mark Sleboda, an associate of Russian political philosopher Alexander Dugin, who has written fascist ideas that reportedly influenced Putin. They also include Gilbert Doctorow, James Jatras, Sergei Markov, Alexander Mercouris and others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lozansky’s American University in Moscow, despite its name, has no specific courses or faculty listed on its site. It claims to have a single course in U.S.-Russia relations, in which well-written essays on the subject can merit a “Certificate of Achievement” in the subject. The certificate appears to have no seals or other distinguishing features.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The university also appears to have the same address as the Russian think-tank Center for Liberal-Conservative Politics. Its director is Russian political operative Alexander Kazakov.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After Russia invaded Donbas in 2014, Kazakov became a PR adviser to the head of the occupation authority, Aleksandr Zakharchenko. After Zakharchenko was killed in an explosion, Kazakov returned to Russia. Kazakov reported to Putin’s adviser Vladislav Surkov, according to Surkov's leaked emails, examined by Cambridge.

                                Many Western writers of disinformation are published by the Strategic Culture Foundation, which is directed by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service and is closely affiliated with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pillars-of-Russia%E2%80%99s-Disinformation-and-Propaganda-Ecosystem_08-04-20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to</a> the U.S. State Department. International Affairs, the flagship journal of the ministry, states that SCF is its partner.

                                According to the State Department, SCF’s core tactic is to legitimize fringe thinkers from the West. International Affairs, the flagship journal of the foreign ministry, states that SCF is its partner.

                            <p>
                                Its Western contributors include Michael Averko, who writes pro-Russian content on Eurasia Review and other sites — he is also associated with the Valdai Discussion Club, an arm of Russia's soft power network.

                                Patrick Armstrong also contributes. He made a video in February, days before the invasion saying “Russia will not invade Ukraine.” He later corrected himself, saying he underestimated NATO’s hostility and the conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s supposed biolabs that make biological weapons to attack Russians.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Contributors also include Pepe Escobar, a Brazilian journalist. The State Department's Global Engagement Center said that outlets that publish or republish Escobar's work are being used by Russia for propaganda and disinformation. These include SCF and Global Research. Escobar frequently appears on RT and Sputnik News.

                                Gilbert Doctorow is a Brussels-based writer who positions himself as a Russia expert. He is currently <a href="https://ruscentre.be/en/forums/gilbert-doktorov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with</a> the Russian Center of Science and Culture in Brussels, <a href="https://ruscentre.be/en/pages/nasha-komanda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">managed</a> by Russia’s soft power network Rossotrudnichestvo.

                                He has articles in the National Interest, The Nation, Russia Insider, Russian media and his website. But most controversy was created by his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181205013222/https:/russia-insider.com/en/politics/letter-editor-jewish-question-and-russia-bashing-west/ri22218" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">defense</a> of an anti-semitic article in Russia Insider titled “It’s time to drop the Jew taboo.”

                            <p>
                                Together with Stephen Cohen, Doctorow helped found ACURA, which once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825214441/https:/eastwestaccord.com/team-member/gilbert-doctorow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">named him</a> a "frequent participant" in events about the "East-West confrontation over Ukraine." He later left the organization and his name appears to have been removed from much of the website. Cohen would later <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/04/12/clarification-regarding-american-committee-east-west-accord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> that Doctorow’s views do not reflect the organization’s.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Both Cohen and Doctorow knew Edward Lozansky and appeared at his forums. On his site, Doctorow writes that he travels to Russia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While he has written misleading articles on many topics, Doctorow often returns to one: falsely saying Russia invaded because of the persecution of Russian-speakers in Ukraine. This “persecution” was invented by Moscow’s mouthpieces. In fact, it’s Russia that’s been indiscriminately killing Ukrainian civilians in cities with large Russian-speaking populations.

They are what the Hitlerites called Untermenschen, against whom all manner of rights violations if not outright murder can be practiced. This arises in its worst form in Ukraine.”

                                Raymond McGovern was a CIA analyst turned political activist. He often writes articles and joins other experts, some mentioned in this story, on panels. He has appeared at Edward Lozansky’s World Russia Forum events. McGovern typically blames the U.S. or NATO for their growing tension with Russia.

                                He helped found Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) in 2003. The group, made up of former intelligence pros, opposed the U.S. war in Iraq. Over time, it increasingly held forth on subjects related to Russia — almost always defending Moscow.

He questioned the findings of the international investigations that determined Russia shot down Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014.

                                He and VIPS denied Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in Aug. 2014, saying it is not “supported by reliable intelligence.”

                                McGovern continued publishing his ideas throughout 2022.

Russia's goal since the very beginning was to take all of Ukraine, which became clear when it tried to blitzkrieg Kyiv.

During one visit, he and VIPS members gave an award to American whistleblower Edward Snowden in Moscow.

                                Few Americans appear on Russian TV to talk about Ukraine more often than Scott Ritter, a former US marine intelligence officer and UN weapons inspector. Among his other claims, he falsely said that the National Police of Ukraine was responsible for the Bucha massacre.

                            <p>
                                The killings of civilians, including in Bucha, were conducted by the Russian occupying forces, according to investigations by Ukraine, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/un-commission-has-found-array-war-crimes-violations-human-rights-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the UN</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/04/21/ukraine-russian-forces-trail-death-bucha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/world/europe/russia-bucha-ukraine-executions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple</a> news <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/national/uncovering-the-scope-of-the-bucha-massacre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">organizations</a>.

                                He claimed that Russia was not responsible for the deadly missile attack at the Kramatorsk train station. Occupation authorities in Donetsk published photos of the launches minutes before impact and falsely claimed that they struck an airfield. They quickly changed the narrative to claim it was a Ukrainian hoax.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He also claimed that Ukrainians don’t know how to use weapons given by the U.S., even as Ukrainians caused massive destruction with American-donated systems. More recently, he claimed that “Russia will still win” despite Ukraine’s successful counter-offensives. Like many, he has accused the government of Ukraine of being Nazis.
                            </p>

                                Ritter used to serve in the Soviet Union as a weapons inspector to enforce the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. He fell in love with and married a young Russian woman he’d met there. According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/stories/unscom101298c.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, she had to report to her country's intelligence services and “Ritter knew he was imperiling his security clearance.”

                                Ritter is a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna45049386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convicted</a> sex offender. He served time for exposing himself to whom he thought was a minor on the internet, but turned out to be an undercover police officer.

                                Ritter appears in the media or on panels with other people in this piece. He was on Consortium News with The Duran founder Alexander Mercouris; and with Ray McGovern and ACURA executive director James Carden at a Covert Action Magazine event in April, among others.

                                Sergey Gladysh was on the board at the Coordinating Council of Organizations of Russian Compatriots, known by its Russian acronym KSORS. He was active largely on the west coast of the U.S. Former KSORS chairman Igor Baboshkin characterized him as a crafty man who got into organizing Russian events because he saw money and opportunities to be made. His work was under the direct supervision of the Russian consulate there, according to Baboshkin.

                                Gladysh founded the Russian-American Cooperation Initiative in Seattle, to “help build professional ties, advance dialogue and cultivate trust” between Americans and Russians. One <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180831140414/https:/russiausa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">banner</a> on his organization showed Putin and Trump shaking hands.

                                He and Branson were members of a <a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2020/09/05/russian-state-linked-figures-promoted-portland-cruise-rally-and-fake-news-site-inciting-new-american-civil-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook group</a> that organized a Trump rally in Portland, Oregon. The group encouraged violence against demonstrators protesting police brutality.

Some of his short content was also published on the conspiracy propaganda site Global Research.

                                The founder of Russia Insider, Bausman went from relatively unknown financial manager to openly writing fascist content. Along the way, his publication has been a major source of Russian disinformation, running many different authors that spread lies on the Kremlin’s behalf. It allegedly got some funding from Russian oligarch Konstantin Maloveev.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An American whose father served as the Moscow bureau chief for the Associated Press, Bausman grew up fond of Russia and spent much of his life there. According to a book by Craig Copetas about the post-Soviet business era, Bausman worked with Russians who were the forerunners of oligarchs as a sort of fixer.

                            <p>
                                Bausman began to reinvent himself around 2014, when he launched Russia Insider to defend Russia’s annexation of Crimea. He continued to write pro-Russian content, while bashing the West and Ukraine.

                            <p>
                                He later became a strong Trump supporter and right-wing organizer, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2021/09/01/far-right-propagandist-turns-moscow-after-jan-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting</a> white supremacists at his property in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, having moved back there by 2018. <br> His articles on Russia Insider became increasingly antisemitic, with titles like  "Adolf Hitler's spot-on 1936 speech on the evil of Soviet bolshevism" and "It's time to drop the jew taboo."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol Building in the U.S., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/03/us/capitol-riot-russia-propagandist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video footage</a> appeared to show Bausman in the crowd. He reportedly fled to Russia after the event, neglecting to even take down the Christmas lights on his Lancaster home.

                                In Moscow, he appeared in Russian media to criticise the West’s response to the war in Ukraine. When asked by the host if he was still a Trump fan, Mr. Bausman said he was not, adding his loyalty can be restored “When [Trump] pardons me for Jan. 6.” Nevertheless, he continued to falsely insist that Trump’s election victory was stolen from him.

                                Bausman made appearances at Lozansky’s World Russia Forum events and sat on panels with other people from these dossiers. He also spoke, seemingly regularly at the Russian Center New York.

                                Jatras has a long history of producing information for Russian organizations and allies. In April, he appeared on RT, where <a href="https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-us-calls-bucha-atrocities-ukrainian-propaganda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a> that the Bucha massacre of March 2022 is “Ukrainian propaganda.” Multiple investigations by foreign media and independent organizations, found that Russians gunned down hundreds of civilians in and around the city.

                                In 2003, he worked with the law firm Venable LLP and signed a lobbying agreement with Alex Kiselev, the representative of then-President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, a corrupt leader under Moscow’s thumb, who was driven out of Ukraine during the EuroMaidan Revolution.

                                Under the agreement, Yanukovych would get “access to high-level figures” in the executive and legislative branches, the media and think tanks, raising his profile. Venable also registered to do work for Russia’s far-right party Rodina.

                                In 2004, Jatras testified as an expert in defense of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic during his genocide tribunal at the Hague. He said that there was not enough exposure of what he called a "militant islamic network" in Bosnia. He later served as the director of the American Council for Kosovo, which lobbies against Kosovo's independence.

                                John Varoli is an American media consultant with journalism experience in Russia. While over there, he produced for Reuters and contributed content to the New York Times and Bloomberg, according to his LinkedIn.

                            <p>
                                Varoli interacted with Elena Branson and her Russian Center New York, speaking at its events. He helped Branson as an interpreter during her organization’s trip to Hawaii.

                            <p>
                                Since the full-scale invasion began, Varoli accused Kyiv of “renewed ethnic cleansing against pro-Russian separatists in the Kharkov (sic) Region.” He called Russia’s invasion of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts as an expression of those regions’ desire for independence from Ukraine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Varoli appears on Russian media. In April, he participated in an RT show, calling Ukraine “a protectorate of the United States, NATO empire” and said that the main goal of the West is to “destroy Russia at any cost.” He complained of heightened “Russophobia” in the US, calling it a “deep, psychological disease” in an interview for the state-owned Russia-24 in 2021.

In an interview with Russian propagandists Yevgeny Popov and Olga Skabeeva about Trump’s telephone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Varoli said “Zelenskyy will do as Trump says” — except that Zelensky didn’t.

                                Sergei Markov is a Russian political scientist and journalist, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Markov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">served</a> as Vladimir Putin’s adviser. In 2008, he received the Gratitude of the President of the Russian Federation award for developing public institutions and defending human rights. He also served on Russian Center New York’s advisory board.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Markov was a doctor of political science at Moscow State University, a professor at the prestigious MGIMO university and a director of the Institute of Political Studies. He also chairs an impressive range of Russian councils. In 2008, he was elected to Russia’s parliament.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Markov said many false things. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he said that "It will not be a war against Ukraine, but to liberate Ukraine" from the pro-Western government that took power in 2014.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In March 2022, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321224724/https:/www.skynews.com.au/world-news/former-advisor-to-vladimir-putin-claims-ukraine-conflict-is-a-proxy-war-between-russia-and-united-states/news-story/b3901ff01bfa5a83dd8273a1d8c8eef9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markov said</a> that Russia’s invasion is not a "war between Russia and Ukraine, it’s a war between Russia and (the) United States puppet who now occupy Ukraine. It’s liberation of Ukraine and it’s a proxy war of the United States against Russia. We believe there’s no independent Ukrainian government and this government is wholly under the control of the United States security community."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It bears repeating that the Ukrainian government is not a U.S. puppet and Russia’s war is about capturing Ukraine and absorbing it into Russia, as Putin has said on multiple occasions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If that wasn’t enough, Markov called on Russians to be as cruel in Ukraine as possible.

                            <p>
                                “The harder Russia beats Ukraine today, the more Russia will be loved there tomorrow,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220912074519/https:/www.business-gazeta.ru/news/563225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “The masses despise softness and love cruelty.”

                                The Duran was founded in 2016 by Alexander Mercouris, a disbarred attorney from London, who became a Russian mouthpiece. The publication's director is Peter Lavelle, host of RT's political debate program CrossTalk, which has featured other people from these dossiers.

                                The Duran regularly publishes hoaxes and fake news, citing questionable sources without any fact checking. This includes stories like “Hillary Clinton sold weapons to ISIS,” and “the US government intentionally engineered the novel coronavirus, overseen by Dr. Anthony Fauci.”

                                On Ukraine, it published misleading videos titled "Ukraine counter-offensive this might be Zelensky's last stand," "Russian economy strengthens, EU economies in tatters," It sometimes copy-pastes content from other questionable sites like Zerohedge and the Strategic Culture Foundation. Many articles are sourced from RT and Sputnik.

                                The website is owned by the Cyprus-based DRN Media PLC. Moscow native Alex Christoforou is the President and Chairman. Funding for The Duran supposedly comes from Paypal and Patreon donations and advertising.

                                Founded by Charles Bausman, Russia Insider has a history of publishing falsehoods and inflammatory content, its own and republished from other sources. It was founded in 2014, right when Putin needed outlets to justify Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of parts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bausman claimed that support for Russia Insider was crowdfunded. But leaked emails published by The Interpreter revealed that he had <a href="https://www.stopfake.org/en/is-russia-insider-sponsored-by-a-russian-oligarch-with-the-ties-to-the-european-far-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked for money</a> from Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, who is close to the Kremlin and owns disinformation network Tsargrad.

                                Russia Insider is aimed at English-speakers and ran stories like “Putin to Obama: You’re Turning the U.S.A. Into a Godless Sewer,” “The latest Russian fighter jet blows America’s away,” and “Anti-Christian Pogrom Underway in Ukraine.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The site often aggregated content, including from the state-owned network RT. Eventually, its articles got so anti-semitic that RT <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/too-racist-for-russian-propaganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disavowed</a> it. These articles included direct defences of Adolf Hitler and long rants against Jewish people. One tag read “Hitler was a great man.”

                                Another title from this year stands out: “Russians Are the Nicest Colonizers You Can Hope For.” There are also many articles glorifying Putin.

All three sites, Russia Insider, National Justice and Truth to Power News attacked Jews, women, nonwhites, LGBT people and leftists.

                                The center was founded by Michel Chossudovsky, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Ottawa. It gave a platform to conspiracy theory writers on multiple different topics, from the September 11 attacks and Osama Bin Laden to vaccines, global warming and Ukraine. Chossudovsky’s status as an academic helped burnish the image of Global Research and its contributors.
